## Maintainership

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. Project maintainers have
the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits,
code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with
this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for
other behaviors they deem inappropriate.

Additionally, project maintainers are obligated to:

* Support contributors in understanding and adhering to the standards.
* Regularly review comments, commits, issues, and other project contributions.
* Approve or reject comments, commits, issues, and other project contributions
  based on adherence to community guidelines.
* Consistently enforce community guidelines.

### Policy Scope

This Code of Conduct applies exclusively to official project spaces, mediums,
and accounts owned by and representative of the project. Examples of project
representation include using an official project email address, posting via an
official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an
online or offline event.

Please note that this does not include the personal public or private social
media accounts, non-project-related websites, emails, communications, or
activities, whether online or offline, of any participant of this project,
maintainer, or individual contributor alike. Representation of the project may
be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Policy Enforcement

Instances of violations may be reported by contacting the project maintainers
via official project communication channels. All complaints will be reviewed
and investigated, and a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the
circumstances will be issued. The project team is obligated to maintain
confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
Possible consequences for violations include, but are not limited to, warnings,
temporary or permanent bans, or other actions as deemed necessary by the
project maintainers.
